# Sentiment Analysis From Tweets Using LinearSVC
Implemented an SVM classifier to interpret the sentiment of user tweets on a dataset of approx. 27,000 instances. This analysis involves several steps including data pre-processing, feature extraction, cross-validation, error analysis, and optimization. Through systematic experimentation of each technique, we explore various optimization strategies to improve the classifier modelâ€™s performance, aiming to better classify user sentiment.

**Basic Sentiment Analysis:**

This notebook provides a foundational understanding of sentiment analysis using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on a dataset of tweets. Implemented data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. The goal is to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, serving as an introductory project in natural language processing and machine learning.

**Optimized Sentiment Analysis Notebook:**

This notebook builds upon the basic sentiment analysis by implementing optimization techniques to enhance model performance. It explores advanced preprocessing methods, feature engineering strategies, and hyperparameter tuning for the SVM classifier. Through systematic experimentation and analysis, the notebook aims to improve sentiment classification accuracy and provide insights into effective optimization strategies for real-world applications.
