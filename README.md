# Sentiment Analysis From Tweets Using LinearSVC
Implemented an SVM classifier to interpret the sentiment of user tweets on a dataset of approx. 27,000 instances. This analysis involves several steps including data pre-processing, feature extraction, cross-validation, error analysis, and optimization. Through systematic experimentation of each technique, we explore various optimization strategies to improve the classifier modelâ€™s performance, aiming to better classify user sentiment.
